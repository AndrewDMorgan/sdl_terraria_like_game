# sdl_terraria_like_game
A terraria like game using metal shader language, sdl2, and rust. Not sure how far I'll take the game though.

Note: to run, currently you need to swap the commented line with the uncommented line in src/core/rendering/mod.rs (swap line 37 with line 36). Currently, until I have an actual game ui, I can't easily have the player choose to or not to load worlds, so it's set just to loading worlds, although currently, there isn't a complete set to load in the first place.
